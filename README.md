## Resume NER - Named Entity Recognition on Resume Data

This repository contains data and notebooks for the SAKI_2019 Course Exercise #2. Clone these files to your computer and work through the notebooks to complete the exercise. 

The exercise is divided up into three parts. The first two parts consist of 2 notebooks and can be executed locally on your laptop. The third part needs to be run in the cloud on a GPU on Google Colab. There are separate notebooks for that part of the exercise which will walk you through working with Google colab.
